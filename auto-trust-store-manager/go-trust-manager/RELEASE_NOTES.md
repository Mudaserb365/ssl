# Trust Store Manager v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Trust Store Manager is a cross-platform utility for discovering and managing trust stores across various environments. This Go implementation replaces the original bash script with a more robust, efficient, and cross-platform solution.

## Key Improvements

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Windows Support**: Full functionality on Windows systems without requiring WSL or Cygwin
- **Linux/macOS Support**: Maintains all original functionality on Unix-like systems
- **Single Binary Distribution**: No dependencies on shell interpreters or external scripts

### Performance Optimizations
- **Optimized Keytool Detection**: Smart path targeting reduces disk I/O with targeted pattern matching instead of recursive directory walks
- **Environment Variable Integration**: Uses JAVA_HOME and other environment variables for faster tool location
- **Parallel Processing**: Improved handling of multiple trust stores with concurrent operations
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: Smaller memory footprint compared to shell script execution

### Reliability Improvements
- **Strong Error Handling**: Go's type safety and error handling provide more robust operation
- **Automatic Recovery**: Better backup and restore capabilities if modifications fail
- **Runtime-Specific Adaptations**: Automatically adjusts behavior based on the host operating system

### Security Enhancements
- **Native Certificate Handling**: Uses Go's crypto packages for certificate operations when possible
- **Safer Password Handling**: Improved storage and use of keystore passwords
- **Isolated Process Model**: No shell injection vulnerabilities

### Maintainability
- **Modular Architecture**: Code organized into logical modules for easier maintenance
- **Unit Testability**: Go's testing framework enables comprehensive test coverage
- **Dependency Management**: Clear management of external dependencies

### Feature Enhancements
- **Enhanced Certificate Generation**: Native Go implementation for certificate creation when OpenSSL isn't available
- **Improved Trust Store Detection**: More comprehensive search for trust stores in various configurations
- **Better Docker/Kubernetes Integration**: Enhanced container support

## Platform-Specific Notes
