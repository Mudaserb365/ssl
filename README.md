# Trust Store Management Tools

A comprehensive collection of tools for managing SSL/TLS trust stores across various environments and application frameworks. This project provides both **Bash scripts** and **Go software** implementations for automated trust store discovery, comparison, and management.

## Project Structure

This repository contains **two distinct, self-contained projects**:

| Project | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [`bash-trust-store-manager/`](./bash-trust-store-manager/) | **Shell-based tools** with broad compatibility | System administration, simple automation, legacy environments |
| [`go-trust-store-manager/`](./go-trust-store-manager/) | **Cross-platform binary** with advanced features | Enterprise environments, CI/CD pipelines, complex automation |

## Quick Start

### Choose Your Implementation

**Option 1: Bash Scripts** (Universal compatibility)
```bash
cd bash-trust-store-manager
./trust-store-manager.sh --help
```

**Option 2: Go Binary** (Advanced features)
```bash
cd go-trust-store-manager
./bin/trust-store-manager-darwin-arm64 --help  # Choose your platform
```

## Core Capabilities

Both implementations provide identical core functionality:

- **Automatic Discovery**: Find trust stores in various formats (JKS, PKCS12, PEM)
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare trust stores against standard certificate bundles
- **Synchronized Updates**: Add/remove certificates consistently across environments
- **Safe Operations**: Automatic backups before modifications
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview changes with `--noop` flag
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for Java, Python, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes

### Advanced Features (Go Only)
- **Interactive Mode**: Guided walkthrough for beginners
- **Webhook Logging**: Enterprise monitoring and audit trails
- **Project Detection**: Automatic runtime environment identification
- **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale operations

## Documentation

- **[Trust Store Management Guide](./trust-store-management.md)** - Comprehensive usage documentation
- **[Getting Started Guide](./starthere.md)** - Quick introduction and concepts

### Project-Specific Documentation
- **[Bash Implementation README](./bash-trust-store-manager/README.md)**
- **[Go Implementation README](./go-trust-store-manager/README.md)**
- **[Go Implementation Tutorial](./go-trust-store-manager/TUTORIAL.md)**

## Installation

### Bash Scripts
```bash
cd bash-trust-store-manager
# Scripts are ready to use - no installation required
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Go Binary
```bash
cd go-trust-store-manager
./install.sh  # Install binary to your PATH
```

## Examples

### Dry-Run Mode (Preview Changes)
```bash
# Bash
./bash-trust-store-manager/trust-store-manager.sh --noop -d /path/to/project -v

# Go  
./go-trust-store-manager/bin/trust-store-manager-darwin-arm64 --noop --auto -d /path/to/project -v
```

### Add Certificate to All Trust Stores
```bash
# Bash
./bash-trust-store-manager/trust-store-manager.sh -d /path/to/project -c /path/to/cert.pem

# Go
./go-trust-store-manager/bin/trust-store-manager-darwin-arm64 --auto -d /path/to/project -c /path/to/cert.pem
```

### Interactive Walkthrough (Go Only)
```bash
./go-trust-store-manager/bin/trust-store-manager-darwin-arm64 --interactive
```

## System Requirements

### Common Requirements
- **OpenSSL** - Certificate manipulation
- **Java keytool** - JKS trust store management (when working with Java keystores)

### Bash-Specific
- **Bash 4.0+**
- Standard Unix utilities (find, grep, etc.)

### Go-Specific  
- No additional dependencies (statically compiled binaries)

## Environment Support

| Environment | Bash Scripts | Go Binary | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Local Development** | Supported | Supported | Full feature support |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Supported | Supported | Automated operations |
| **Docker Containers** | Supported | Supported | Container-aware scanning |
| **Kubernetes Clusters** | Supported | Supported | ConfigMap and Secret support |
| **Cloud Platforms** | Supported | Supported | AWS, Azure, GCP compatible |
| **Legacy Systems** | Supported | Limited | Bash preferred for older systems |
| **Windows** | Limited | Supported | Go binary recommended |

## Choosing Between Implementations

### Use **Bash Scripts** When:
- Working with legacy or restricted environments
- Need maximum compatibility across Unix-like systems
- Prefer simple, readable scripts that can be easily customized
- System administrators familiar with shell scripting
- Minimal dependencies required

### Use **Go Binary** When:
- Need enterprise features (webhooks, interactive mode)
- Working in modern development environments
- Require cross-platform compatibility (including Windows)
- Performance is important for large-scale operations
- Want a single, self-contained executable

## Security Considerations

- Always validate certificate sources and URLs
- Use `--noop` mode to preview changes before execution
- Create backups before modifying production trust stores  
- Implement proper access controls for trust store management
- Monitor all trust store modifications via logging/webhooks
