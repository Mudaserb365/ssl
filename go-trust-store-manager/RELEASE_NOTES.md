# Trust Store Manager v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Trust Store Manager is a cross-platform utility for discovering and managing trust stores across various environments. This Go implementation replaces the original bash script with a more robust, efficient, and cross-platform solution.

## Key Improvements

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Windows Support**: Full functionality on Windows systems without requiring WSL or Cygwin
- **Linux/macOS Support**: Maintains all original functionality on Unix-like systems
- **Single Binary Distribution**: No dependencies on shell interpreters or external scripts

### Performance Optimizations
- **Optimized Keytool Detection**: Smart path targeting reduces disk I/O with targeted pattern matching instead of recursive directory walks
- **Environment Variable Integration**: Uses JAVA_HOME and other environment variables for faster tool location
- **Parallel Processing**: Improved handling of multiple trust stores with concurrent operations
- **Reduced Resource Usage**: Smaller memory footprint compared to shell script execution

### Reliability Improvements
- **Strong Error Handling**: Go's type safety and error handling provide more robust operation
- **Automatic Recovery**: Better backup and restore capabilities if modifications fail
- **Runtime-Specific Adaptations**: Automatically adjusts behavior based on the host operating system

### Security Enhancements
- **Native Certificate Handling**: Uses Go's crypto packages for certificate operations when possible
- **Safer Password Handling**: Improved storage and use of keystore passwords
- **Isolated Process Model**: No shell injection vulnerabilities

### Maintainability
- **Modular Architecture**: Code organized into logical modules for easier maintenance
- **Unit Testability**: Go's testing framework enables comprehensive test coverage
- **Dependency Management**: Clear management of external dependencies

### Feature Enhancements
- **Enhanced Certificate Generation**: Native Go implementation for certificate creation when OpenSSL isn't available
- **Improved Trust Store Detection**: More comprehensive search for trust stores in various configurations
- **Better Docker/Kubernetes Integration**: Enhanced container support
- **Remote Webhook Logging**: Send operation logs to centralized monitoring systems via HTTP webhooks
- **Interactive Engineer-Friendly Mode**: Step-by-step guided walkthrough for trust store management
- **Automatic Project Type Detection**: Smart identification of Java, Python, and Node.js projects
- **Runtime-Specific Optimizations**: Tailored workflows for different programming languages

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Webhook Integration**: Send logs to centralized monitoring systems via HTTP
- **Host Information Collection**: Automatically gather and report system details with logs
- **JSON-Formatted Logs**: Structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
- **Configurable API Authentication**: Support for API keys when sending logs to protected endpoints
- **Rich Metadata Context**: Additional operation-specific data for deeper analysis
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Distinct levels for different operational situations
- **Integration Ready**: Pre-configured for popular logging ecosystems

#### Webhook JSON Format
Logs are sent in a standardized JSON format that includes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-03-29T13:45:30Z",
  "level": "INFO|SUCCESS|WARNING|ERROR",
  "message": "Log message text",
  "host": {
    "hostname": "server-name",
    "ip_addresses": ["192.168.1.100", "10.0.0.5"],
    "os": "linux|windows|darwin",
    "os_version": "20.04|10.0.19042|12.3.1",
    "arch": "amd64|arm64"
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```

This format facilitates easy integration with log aggregation systems like ELK Stack, Graylog, or cloud logging services.

#### Metadata Enrichment

The `metadata` field provides operation-specific context that varies by log type:

**Trust Store Operations**:
```json
"metadata": {
  "file_type": "JKS|PEM|PKCS12",
  "operation": "import|update|verify",
  "certificate_count": 75,
  "certificate_fingerprint": "SHA256:..."
}
```

**System Events**:
```json
"metadata": {
  "cpu_usage": 12.5,
  "memory_usage": 256.4,
  "disk_free": 10240
}
```

**Error Conditions**:
```json
"metadata": {
  "error_code": "AUTH_FAILED",
  "attempted_passwords": 3,
  "stacktrace": "...",
  "recoverable": true
}
```

#### Use Cases for Webhook Logging

- **Compliance Tracking**: Maintain audit logs of all certificate operations
- **Fleet Management**: Monitor trust store updates across distributed systems
- **Alerting**: Create alerts based on ERROR level logs or specific patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Track performance metrics over time for optimization
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect suspicious patterns or unauthorized operations
- **Troubleshooting**: Aggregate logs for easier debugging of distributed issues

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows
- Automatically detects JDK/JRE installations from Registry and standard installation paths
- Supports Windows-specific environment variables like ProgramFiles
- Handles path differences and executable extensions (.exe) automatically

### macOS
- Full support for macOS-specific Java installations (including Apple Silicon)
- Integration with Homebrew-installed OpenJDK variants

### Linux
- Maintains compatibility with all Linux distributions
- Support for systemd service management when modifying system trust stores

## Getting Started

Download the appropriate binary for your platform and run. No installation required:

```
./trust-store-manager -v
```

For an interactive, guided experience (recommended for first-time users):

```
./trust-store-manager
```

For centralized logging and monitoring, use the webhook functionality:

```
./trust-store-manager --webhook --webhook-url https://logs.example.com/api --webhook-key your-api-key
```

See the README.md for complete documentation and usage examples.

## Engineer Experience

The Trust Store Manager v1.0.0 includes significant improvements to the engineer experience:

### Interactive Walkthrough Mode

When run without arguments, the tool enters a guided walkthrough mode that:

- Automatically detects project types based on code and configuration files
- Provides contextual help for each option
- Offers sensible defaults based on detected runtime
- Explains technical concepts in simple terms
- Shows a final configuration summary before execution

### Simplified Decision Making

The tool simplifies complex trust store management by:

- Identifying the programming language in use (Java, Python, Node.js)
- Suggesting appropriate trust store formats for each runtime
- Offering pre-configured profiles for common scenarios
- Using clear, non-technical language where possible
- Providing contextual examples during the walkthrough

### Error Resilience

The interactive mode includes enhanced error handling:

- Input validation prevents common mistakes
- Detailed error messages with suggested fixes
- Safe defaults to prevent accidental trust store corruption
- Automatic creation of backups before any modifications
- Step-by-step verification of changes after completion
