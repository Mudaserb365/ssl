Trust Store Management: Comprehensive Use Cases and Permutations
Introduction
Your current trust store management solution covers many common scenarios, but there are additional use cases and permutations worth considering. This document outlines all possible permutations for updating trust stores in runtime environments.
Core Use Cases
1. System-Level Trust Stores
| Environment | Current Coverage | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Linux PEM/CRT/CERT | ✅ | Common locations covered |
| Java JKS | ✅ | Password handling included |
| Docker containers | ✅ | Both runtime and build-time solutions |
| CloudFormation | ✅ | User data script provided |
2. Missing Use Cases
Application-Specific Trust Stores
| Application Type | Description | Implementation Needs |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Node.js | Node.js maintains its own CA store | Need to update NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable |
| Python | Applications may use custom CA bundles | Need to update requests.Session() or SSL_CERT_FILE |
| Ruby | Custom CA stores in Ruby applications | Need to update OpenSSL::X509::Store |
| Go | Custom cert pools in Go applications | Need to update crypto/x509 CertPool |
| .NET | Custom certificate stores | Need to update X509Store or app config |
Container Orchestration Platforms
| Platform | Description | Implementation Needs |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Kubernetes | Pod-level and cluster-level certificates | ConfigMaps, Secrets, and init containers |
| ECS/Fargate | AWS container services | Task definitions and container initialization |
| OpenShift | Enterprise Kubernetes | Security Context Constraints and trusted CA config |
Cloud-Native Services
| Service Type | Description | Implementation Needs |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| AWS Lambda | Serverless functions | Lambda layers or custom runtime initialization |
| Azure Functions | Serverless functions | Custom startup scripts or extensions |
| Cloud Run | Managed container service | Container startup scripts |
| App Engine | PaaS environments | Startup scripts or custom runtimes |
Implementation Permutations
1. Trust Store Types
| Trust Store Type | Format | Tools | Special Considerations |
|------------------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| System CA bundle | PEM/CRT/CERT | OpenSSL, update-ca-certificates | OS-specific locations |
| Java KeyStore | JKS | keytool | Password protection, alias management |
| PKCS#12 | P12/PFX | OpenSSL | Password protection, private key handling |
| Windows Certificate Store | System store | certutil | Registry-based, requires admin rights |
| Application-specific | Various | Custom scripts | Application restart may be required |
| NSS databases | cert8.db, cert9.db | certutil | Used by Firefox, Thunderbird |
2. Update Mechanisms
| Mechanism | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----------|------|------|----------|
| File replacement | Simple, direct | May require service restart | Static environments |
| Certificate append | Non-destructive | May accumulate outdated certs | Production systems |
| Scheduled updates | Automated maintenance | Requires scheduler | Long-running systems |
| Event-driven updates | Real-time response | Complex setup | Critical systems |
| Init-time only | Simple deployment | No runtime updates | Immutable infrastructure |
| Sidecar container | Isolation, dedicated | Resource overhead | Kubernetes environments |
3. Distribution Methods
| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Central HTTP(S) endpoint | Pull from central server | Cross-platform compatibility |
| Git repository | Version-controlled certificates | DevOps-oriented teams |
| Configuration management | Ansible, Chef, Puppet | Enterprise environments |
| Secret management | Vault, AWS Secrets Manager | Sensitive certificates |
| Package repository | OS package manager | System-level trust stores |
| Container registry | Custom base images | Container-based deployments |
